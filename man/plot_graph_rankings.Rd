\description{
This function will produce plots of graph analysis of predicted
gene regulatory networks. It takes in the output of run_tf_aen
and generates graph and ranking plots of top TFs. It calculates
two centrality measures, betweenness and PageRank, to determine
most central TFs to plot. In order to prioritize TFs that are
central, rather than targets, for PageRank, edges are reversed.
The function returns a graph and ranking plot for each measure
of centrality.
